An abstract class is a way to achieve abstraction in Java.
It is declared using the abstract keyword and can contain both abstract methods non abstract methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and are meant to be extended by subclasses.
Besides abstraction, abstract classes also allow code reusability through shared behavior and state.
